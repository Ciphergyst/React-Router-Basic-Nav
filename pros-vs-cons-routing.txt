Client side routing has manu pros vs Server side routing  by removing alot of the network load and computation,
the server has to make in any given moment. Each click, or user interaction with the page or application shouldnt have
to "phone home" each and every time to render or compose new elements and data. By shifting this requirement to the clients side,
information can be rendered faster in most cases and frees up the server to apply its resources and computations to more important tasks
this can effect many other interactions with the application that are bothe beneficial to the user and the content provider.

Some cons might be heavy websites with multiple pages and resources may take slighlty longer on the initial load because the entire site is being rendered 
locally and some of the data may not even be necessary based on the users interaction. There is also a bit more code required to set up efficient
client-side routing. Also SEO can be less optimized being Server-side was the standard for so long, search engines are not yet completely optimized to
index client-side pages and content. I beleieve more and more inovation, and optimixzation will occur that will enable client-side rendering to be the
new norm for most web application and sites.
